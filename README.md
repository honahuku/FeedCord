# FeedCord: Self-hosted RSS Reader for Discord

FeedCord is designed to be a 'turn key' automated RSS feed reader with the main focus on Discord Servers. 

Use it for increasing community engagement and activity or just for your own personal use. The combination of FeedCord and Discord's Forum Channels can really shine to make a vibrant news feed featuring gallery-style display alongside custom threads, creating an engaging space for your private community discussions.

### An example of what FeedCord can bring to your server

## Running FeedCord

FeedCord is very simple to get up and running. It only takes a few steps:

- Create a Discord Webhook
- Create and Edit a local file or two

Provided below is a quick guide to get up and running.


## Quick Setup

### 1. Create a new folder with a new file named `appsettings.json` inside with the following content:

```json
{
  "Instances": [
    {
      "Id": "My First News Feed",
      "YoutubeUrls": [
        ""
      ],
      "RssUrls": [
        ""
      ],
      "Forum": false,
      "DiscordWebhookUrl": "...",
      "RssCheckIntervalMinutes": 25,
      "EnableAutoRemove": false,
      "Color": 8411391,
      "DescriptionLimit": 250,
      "MarkdownFormat": false,
      "PersistenceOnShutdown": true
    }
  ],
  "ConcurrentRequests": 40
}
```
There is currently 17 properties you can configure. You can read more in depth explanation of the file structure as well as view all properties and their purpose [here](https://github.com/Qolors/FeedCord/blob/master/FeedCord/docs/reference.md)

### 2. Create a new Webhook in Discord (Visual Steps Provided)

![Discord Webhook](https://github.com/Qolors/FeedCord/blob/master/FeedCord/docs/images/webhooks.png)


### Quick Note

Be sure to populate your `appsettings.json` *"DiscordWebhookUrl"* property with your newly created Webhook

Before you actually run FeedCord, make sure you have populated your `appsettings.json` with RSS and YouTube feeds.

**RSS Feeds**

- For new users that aren't bringing their own list check out [awesome-rss-feeds](https://github.com/plenaryapp/awesome-rss-feeds) and add some that interest you
- Each url is entered by line seperating by comma. It should look like this in your `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"RssUrls": [
       "https://examplesrssfeed1.com/rss",
       "https://examplesrssfeed2.com/rss",
       "https://examplesrssfeed3.com/rss",
     ]
```

**YouTube Feeds**

- You can bring your favorite YouTube channels as well to be notified of new uploads
- FeedCord parses from the channel's base url so simply navigate to the channel home page and use that url.
- Example here if I was interested in Unbox Therapy & Tyler1:

***NOTE***

If a YouTube link keeps failing at retrieving the RSS Link - Directly use the xml formatted YouTube link. It is more reliable.

The format for that looks like: `"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id={YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE}"`

You can use online web tools like [tunepocket](https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-channel-id-finder/?srsltid=AfmBOorSH1Ye9r1erCzY2qaqV_pUa23U8wG-DeAMAhGfGZ9dbMY5RE2j) to get the Id for the channel.

```json
"YoutubeUrls": [
       "https://www.youtube.com/@unboxtherapy",
       "https://www.youtube.com/@TYLER1LOL",
       "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id={YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE}"
     ]
```

### Running FeedCord

Now that your file is set up, you have two ways to run FeedCord

### Docker (Recommended)

```sh
# When using a remote image
docker pull qolors/feedcord:latest

# Be sure to update the volume path to your `appsettings.json` 
docker run --name FeedCord -v "/path/to/your/appsettings.json:/app/config/appsettings.json" qolors/feedcord:latest
```

```sh
# Build and run a local dockerfile (e.g., if you make changes to the source code)
docker build -t feedcord ./FeedCord && \
docker run --rm -v "./appsettings.json:/app/config/appsettings.json" feedcord

# check container log
docker logs feedcord
```

### Build From Source

Install the [.NET SDK](dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Qolors/FeedCord
```
Change Directory
```
cd FeedCord
```
Restore Dependencies
```
dotnet restore
```
Build
```
dotnet build
```
Run with your `appsettings.json` (provide your own path)
```
dotnet run -- path\to\your\appsettings.json
```


With the above steps completed, FeedCord should now be running and posting updates from your RSS feeds directly to your Discord channel.
